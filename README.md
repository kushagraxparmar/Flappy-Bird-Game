This repository contains a JavaScript implementation of the classic game Flappy Bird. The game provides a simple and enjoyable experience, challenging players to navigate a bird through a series of pipes without colliding with them.

**Features:**

- Dynamic generation of pipes at regular intervals.
- Scoring system to track the player's progress.
- Game over detection upon collision with pipes or when the bird falls off the screen.
- Support for both keyboard and mouse controls.
- Added some music to make this a fun experience.

**Gameplay Instructions:**
- The objective is to navigate the bird through the openings between the pipes.
- Press the spacebar or up arrow key to make the bird jump.
- Each successful passage through a pair of pipes earns the player a point.
- Colliding with a pipe or falling off the screen ends the game.
- After the game ends, press any key or click anywhere to restart and try again.
